# Fozboy - Game Boy Color Emulator

A _prospective_ Game Boy Color emulator written in C, built with zig, and with a TUI frontend in Go.

## Running
```bash
zig build
go run main.go
```

Sometimes you may need to clear your go cache, in which case run this instead

`go clean --cache && go run main.go`
